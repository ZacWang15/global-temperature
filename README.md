# Global Temperature Data

This project provides temperature (celsius degree) globally in land area by 0.3 degree x 0.3 degree grids.

The data is at monthly interval from 1950 till now and dataset will update every month.

## How to use
The tool can match a latitude, longitude point to the nearest point in the grid and return the celsius degree according to year, month you pass to it.
